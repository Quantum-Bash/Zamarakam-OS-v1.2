I made this Python OS by watching tutorials from Cyber coding. Link to his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYLG90eYy6OxeINDgsAnDhw .

ZamarakamOS v1.2

Download instructions:

use "pip install" (without the quotation marks) to download these files.

download python 3.8 on Linux/MacOS by opening the terminal and pasting the following: sudo apt install python 3.8.
On Windows download the file by going to https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download pip on Windows by opening cmd (press windowskey+r and type cmd.exe) and then just pate the following: py get-pip.py
On linux open the terminal and paste the following: python3.8 -m pip install -U pip
For BSD you should probably know how to if not why did you download it in the first place. BSD is one of the most hardest OS to understand.

The following are the required dependencies:

python 3.8

psutil

PyQtWebEngine

PyQt5

TK

wget

paste version:

pip install psutil

pip install PyQtWebEngine

pip install PyQt5

pip install TK

pip install wget

This OS is NOT concerned with security and instead is just a fun litle OS to play around with.

ZamarakamOS v1.2 new features:

More terminal commands.

SuperTerminal with the ability to download files.

hidden python files (for linux and BSD).

shutdown option improved.
